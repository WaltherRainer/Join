                is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p><br><br>

            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <p><span class="help_joinText">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
                group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="help_joinText">Join</span> leverages
                the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
                interface. <br><br>
                It is important to note that <span class="help_joinText">Join</span> is designed as an educational
                exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible
